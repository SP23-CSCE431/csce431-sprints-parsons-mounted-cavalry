            <h2>Logging In</h2>
            <h4>Why can't I login?</h4>
            <p>Make sure that you are using your @tamu.edu email. If it still does not work, contact your command staff to make sure that they inputted your email correctly when they created your account.</p>

            <h2>Checking In</h2>
            <h4>How do I check in?</h4>
            <p>First, login to PMC Attendance website using your @tamu.edu email. Then, go to the Check In page. There, if you have an appointment at PMC, you will see the date of your appointment, the horse (if any) you are assigned, the purpose of your appointment, and your check in time. If the check in time is red, then you have not checked in, so click the Check In button. The check in box should then turn green and show the time that you checked in.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Why am I getting this message when I try to check in? "YOU ARE NOT AT PARSONS MOUNTED CAVALRY! PLEASE CHECK IN WHEN YOU HAVE ARRIVED."</h4>
            <p>In order to ensure that cadets are being truthful when they check in, we check that you are located at the PMC office before we let you check in. If you are receiving this message, please try checking in at the PMC Main office (3748 F and B Rd, College Station, TX 77845).</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Why am I getting an error when I try to check in?</h4>
            <p>One reason may be that you don't have your location services turned on. Please make sure that your location is turned on so that our website can locate you.</p>

            <h2>Command Staff / Admin</h2>
            <h4>What does the Condition option for horses mean?</h4>
            <p>This input can be used to store the current condition of the horse. For example, if it is Healthy, Injured, Out of Service, etc.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Why am I getting an error when I try to create/edit a user?</h4>
            <p>One reason may be that you have not filled in all of the required inputs necessary in the create/edit forms.</p>
            <p>Another reason may be that your phone number or email input is incorrect. The phone number must be valid and use the format: 1234567890. Make sure not to use dashes or parenthesis when typing it in. The email must be an @tamu.edu email.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Why can't I make a new attendance for a Command Staff/Cadet?</h4>
            <p>This problem occurs when a user doesn't have a schedule yet. Go ahead and click on their name or the red exclamation point by their name to create a schedule for them, then you should be able to create an attendance for that user.</p>
